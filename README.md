I am a new developer getting hand-ons on git version control.

Firstly, I created a directory using "mkdir", created a new file in the directory using "touch". I changed to the directory that I just created using "cd"

I created a new branch and merge the changes from the new branch to the master branch.

I also created another new branch, created a conflict and resolved it.

I will keep on working on this project as I am learning more on git version control.
